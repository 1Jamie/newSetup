# New Computer Setup

Designed for me to easily setup a new computer with the tools I need/like
to have right from the get go.

This also clones my conky and implements it while telling me if the 
core/thread count is going to match up with it or not

## Installed packages

```
chromium-browser
conky-all
discord
displaylink drivers
dkms (needed for displaylink)
gawk
gparted
libcairo5.3-dev
lua5.3
net-tools
slack
vanilla-gnome-desktop
virtualbox
VSCode
conky-prime (system monitor overly)
```
